# React HIKETRACKER
Like hiking and need to record some data about your walks? You've found the right app!

## Motivation
Actually, this project is for now just a test. I wanted to practice building a React app from scratch, setting up Webpack, Babel, and linking React with Redux, React-Router.

## Project status
It's an early stage and quite a work-in-progress.
It has basic functionality but a database and the possibility to create and account and authenticate will (likely) be set up in the future. 

## Setup
npm install

## How to run
npm start

## How to use
The landing page is just for esthetics.
You can navigate the app by clicking on "My Hikes" on the top-right corner, see a (for now empty) list of hikes, click on the "add" button and fill the form to add a new entry to the list.
The heading logo on the top-left corner will take you back to the landing page.

## Practiced features
- Webpack and Babel setup from scratch
- Routing with react-router
- Managing state with Redux
- Unit testing with Jest

## Known issues

## Future features
- Persist data to local storage
- More values (location, scenery rating, difficulty...)
- New UI for the hike list
- Database
- Authentication

## Images
The background in the home section was taken by me.
