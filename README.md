# React HIKETRACKER

## Motivation
It's practice project that I used to build a React app from scratch, set up Webpack, Babel, link React with Redux, set up routing with React-Router, then connect the app to a Firebase database to store the data.

## Project status
The main functionaliy is working: you can navigate to the hike list, the app will retrieve the data from the database and render it, then you can add a new one, it will be saved in the database and the list will update as well.
The hikes will be saved to an open database (as it is just a demo project).

## How to use
You can navigate the app by clicking on "My Hikes" on the top-right corner, see a (for now empty) list of hikes, click on the "add" button and fill the form to add a new entry to the list.
The heading logo on the top-left corner will take you back to the landing page.
